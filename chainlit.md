### Prompt approach:

**Classic:**

```
CONTEXT:
{{context}}

QUERY:
{{question}}

Answer questions only based on provided context and not your previous knowledge. 
In your answer never mention phrases like Based on provided context, From the context etc.
If you don't know the answer say I don't know!
```
### My idea was to move away from this 101 RAG prompt apporach and have LLM give information regarding answer construction in a way - context vs. prior knowledge!

This is still not the best approach, and I would prefer to use more advanced evaluation tehnics, but it helps us understand hallucinations better.
Additionally, 4o model answers can understand this type of prompt, while GPT 3.5 gets confused between prior knowlege and provided context.

**My test approach:**

```
CONTEXT:
{{context}}

QUERY:
{{question}}

Answer questions only based on provided context and not your previous knowledge. 
In your answer never mention phrases like Based on provided context, From the context etc.
If you don't know the answer say I don't know!
